# django_studybuddy

This is a learning project to **learn Django Web Development**.

The project is a web application where users can:
- Login and sign up to the application.
- Create Discussion Rooms.
- Join a Room and talk about a certain topic.
- Update/Delete messages or rooms.
- See Activity Feeds.

In this project I learned:
